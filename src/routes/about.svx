## About this blog

This blog is about
- being delighted about self development and continuous improvement
- having fun with software development and tech
- asking questions and getting better every day
- being clear & curious & humble and having fast feedback loops rather than sounding like I know it all already (I really don't!)
- experimenting with alternative ways to convey interesting concepts (visuals!)

## About me

Iâ€™m curious about a lot of things. I do a lot of things. And I'm not a fan of pigeonholing.
Workise, I'm a software engineer, project management professional, and consultant.
Currently, I work (remotely) at [Bending Spoons](https://bendingspoons.com/). I love it there.
I live in Rome.

I have one main opinion about life, which is that being clear, curious, and humble while keeping an
open mind and exploring is the closest thing we have to a recipe for success.
Or at least for an interesting life.
